In Python, lambda is small anonymous function which are restricted to single line expression. They can take any number or arguments and return the results.
They are generally used when a function is needed temporarily for a short period of time.
They are written as: lambda arguments: expression

********** lambda function  with 2 arguments  *********

********** def function  *********

The type shows that both lambda and def are both functions. Using lambda functions, we can define and call it
immediately at the end of definitions, However we can not  do this using def.
